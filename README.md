# Memory Game Project

This repository contains the complete code to (hopefully) meet the specifications of the final project in Udacity's Front End Web Developer specialization of the Introduction to Programming Nanodegree. The project was to modify/finalize some styling _and_ create the logic for a card-based memory matching game. The structure/style is done in HTML/CSS and the game logic is done in Javascript with jQuery.
